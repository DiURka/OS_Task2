# Directory Listing Program

This Java program lists the contents of a specified directory using the `ls -l` command. Follow the steps below to compile and run the program.

## Compilation

1. **Compile the Java program**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your Java file (`Main.java`), and run the following command:

    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```

    This command compiles the Java source file `Main.java` and generates the corresponding bytecode file (`Main.class`).

## Running the Program

2. **Run the compiled program**: Once the compilation is successful, you can run the compiled program with the appropriate directory path as a command-line argument. For example:

    ```bash
    java Main /path/to/your/directory
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual directory path you want to list the contents of. Make sure to provide the correct path to the directory you want to test.

## Observing the Output

3. **Review the output**: After running the program, it will list the contents of the specified directory along with the exit code of the command. Review the output to verify that it behaves as expected.
